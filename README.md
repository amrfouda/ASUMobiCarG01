Welcome to Group 08	

We're group of students at faculty of engineering, Ain Shams Univeristy. We're working on a smart toy project (RC Car).

This project is based on wireless controlling via microcontroller (Arduino), sensors and ICs.

Our team members are:

Amr Essam

Hesham Samir

Youssef Mahmoud Zaki

Haithem Mustafa

Mahmoud Magdy

Moatassem Adel

Youssef Galal

Youssef Essam

Hesham Hussien


So, here are some notes about our project:

1-  I] The Main Components we bought:

		a) Arduino Mega
		b) Four motors for each wheel
		c) Car body which is an acrylic kit designed by us, and we used laser cutting to fabricate it
		
   II] Other Components:
	
		a) Ultrasonic Sensor
		b) A driver (H-bridge driver for controlling the motors)
		c) Lithium battery with a charger (12 volt)
		d) Bluetooth module
		e) 5-channel line follower
		f) 9 volt battery
		
	** We're planning to add other components for the next stages.
	
2-	We were divided into 3 teams to accomplish stage 1:

	First team members were: Hesham Hussein, Moatassem Adel, Youssef Essam and Youssef Galal.
	This team was responsible to search for the optimum components and buying it, while cooperating with the other teams.
	
	Second team members were: Hesham Samir, Amr Essam and Mahmoud Magdy.
	This team was responsible for setting up the car and its operation.
	
	Third team members were: Haitham Mustafa and Youssef Mahmoud Zaki.
	This team was responsible for the coding and the simulation.
	
3-      To accomplish stage 2:
        
	- Youssef Zaki and Hesham Hussien are responsible for the code.
	- Amr Essam, Mahmoud Magdy, Moatassem Adel and Hesham Samir are responsible for the implementation of the sensor.
