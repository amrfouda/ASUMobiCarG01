Welcome to Group 08	

We're group of students at faculty of engineering, Ain Shams Univeristy. We're working on a smart toy project (RC Car).

This project is based on wireless controlling via microcontroller (Arduino), sensors and ICs.

Our team members are:

Amr Essam
Hesham Samir
Youssef Mahmoud Zaki
Haithem Mustafa
Mahmoud Magdy
Moatassem Adel
Youssef Galal
Youssef Essam
Hesham Hussien

So, here are some notes about our project:

1-	I] The Main Components we bought:

		a) Arduino Mega (250 LE)
		b) Four motors for each wheel (220 LE for each wheel = 880 LE)
		c) Car body which an aclerec kit designed by us, and we used laser cuttiing to fabricate it (100 LE)
		
	II] Other Components:
	
		a) Ultrasonic Sensor (40 LE)
		b) A driver (H-bridge driver for controlling the motors) (65 LE)
		c) Lithium battery with a charger (450 LE)
		d) Bluetooth module (100 LE)
		
	** We're planning to add other components for the next stages.
	
2-	We were divided into 3 teams:

	First team members were: Hesham Hussein, Moatassem Adel, Youssef Essam and Youssef Galal.
	This team was responsible to search for the optimum components and buying it, while cooperating with the other teams.
	
	Second team members were: Hesham Samir, Amr Essam and Mahmoud Magdy.
	This team was responsible for setting up the car and its operation.
	
	Third team members were: Haitham Mustafa and Youssef Mahmoud Zaki.
	This team was responsible for the coding and the simulation.
